## Functionality

*  The application displays the current date at the top of calendar. The time blocks represent the standard business hours from 9:00am till 5:00pm. Each time block is color-coded to help the user distinguish past,present, and future times of any given work day. When the user enters a task into a time block, the information gets stored in the user's browser's local storage. Hence, the input becomes persistent until the user clears out the local storage data.
